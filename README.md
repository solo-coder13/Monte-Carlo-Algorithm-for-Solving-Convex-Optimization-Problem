# Monte-Carlo-Algorithm-for-Solving-Convex-Optimization-Problem
The project aims to develop and implement Monte Carlo algorithms for solving convex optimization problems, focusing on their application to the Max-Cut problem. The Max-Cut problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, making it a challenging but relevant test case for the effectiveness of Monte Carlo methods.

# Monte Carlo Simulation for Max-Cut NP-Hard Problem

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation approach to approximate the solution to the well-known NP-hard Max-Cut problem. It provides insights into the problem's behavior and allows customization for various scenarios.

## Description

The Max-Cut problem aims to partition a graph's vertices into two sets, maximizing the number of edges between them. Finding the optimal partition becomes computationally expensive for large graphs, making it NP-hard.

This project leverages Monte Carlo simulation, an efficient stochastic technique, to find high-quality solutions. It iteratively:

1. Initializes a random spin configuration for each vertex.
2. Calculates the current cut value (edges between vertices with opposite spins).
3. Attempts to improve the cut:
    - Randomly select a vertex and flip its spin.
    - Accept the change if it improves the cut value.
    - Use a simulated annealing strategy for potential probabilistic acceptance.
4. Repeats steps 2-3 for a predefined number of iterations.

## Features
